DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender is a powerful tool for protected mode
programmers to create 16-bit and 32-bit protected mode applications. DOS/32
Advanced has been designed to be the fastest, most flexible and efficient,
as well as highly compatible with other software DOS Extender.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender is fully compatible with WATCOM C/C++
development package and provides a software emulation of the industry
standard DOS/4GW DOS Extender. DOS/32 Advanced supports Clean (also known as
&quot;Raw&quot; or &quot;INT 15h&quot;), XMS, VCPI and DPMI system softwares. It has a built-in
DPMI server v0.9 which can be configured by an external setup program
included with the DOS Extender. DOS/32 Advanced extends most of DOS
functions (available through INT 21h) that are used in WATCOM C/C++
libraries, many of Mouse functions (available through INT 33h) and all of
VESA VBE 2.0 functions (available through INT 10h) which are widely used by
protected mode programmers in games and applications that use SuperVGA video
modes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
Thanks to its design, DOS/32 Advanced can  be configured to take up as
little as 40KB of conventional (DOS) memory and require no Extended memory
to be present when run. A protected mode application can be loaded into DOS
memory, into Extended memory, or into both at the same time. Four different
schemes on how the Objects (parts of  a protected mode program) are loaded
into memory supported. Furthermore, DOS/32 Advanced requires no extended
memory for its proper operation, thus being capable of running protected
mode programs in  environments with no, or very little extended memory
available.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender has been written entirely in the assembly
language, and that is why it is working so fast, supports and extends so
many functions and at the same time is so small in size. Furthermore, after
initialization of the protected mode, DOS/32 Advanced will discard some of
its parts that are no longer needed, additionally freeing some of
conventional memory.</FONT></P>
