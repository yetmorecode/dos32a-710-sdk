<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender
supports Physical Memory Mapping through its built-in DPMI functions 0800h
and 0801h. However the programmers should take a note when using these functions
as they are implemented differently than those available in DOS/4G(W) Extenders.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">As defined by DPMI specification,
when mapping physical memory region into linear memory using function 0800h,
the DPMI host should recognize calls to this functions which map already
mapped physical memory regions and perform no action, instead reporting
the linear address of the linear memory which maps physical memory. However,
DOS/4G(W) DPMI server does not seem to do this and will map the same physical
memory regions twice (or as many times as this function is called) into
different linear memory at different addresses.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">An example would be a
program which maps Linear Framebuffer of a Video card located at 0xE8000000
two times. DOS/4G(W) DOS Extenders will report one linear address the first
time DPMI function 0800h is called, and another, completely different linear
address the second time. This will result in that the program will use two
different linear addresses when accessing one and the same physical address
of memory.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DOS/32 Advanced built-in
DPMI will act differently, and will always check whether the physical memory
region being mapped by the application has already been mapped. If that
is the case, DOS/32 Advanced will report the linear address of the previously
mapped memory block. Please note that this behavior of DOS/32 Advanced ADPMI
does not impact the compatibility with DOS/4G(W) Extenders and is completely
transparent to the application which uses Physical Memory Mapping. On the
other hand this will also save you the valuable linear memory and Page Tables.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Please note that Physical
Memory Mapping will require allocation of additional Page Tables when running
under VCPI. If you are not planning to use DPMI functions 0800h and 0801h
in your programs, and you want to free up some of DOS memory, you may lower
the number of the Page Tables reserved by the DOS Extender for Physical
Memory Mapping, VCPI PhysTables, by using the <A HREF="../util/3.htm">SUNSYS
Setup Utility</A> program.
